## Log

### R1D1 
I worked among the icon system in my future blog app.

### R1D2
I finalished my navigation header and started working on the option box for my posts.

### R1D3
I finished with the icon system and now all the icons works properly. I messed up a bit with the svg, so it deserves a future refactor. Pretty happy about it anyway.

### R1D4
Today i woke up earlier to complete my daily commitment. I added the copy of the page and the noisy bg, so the page is completed. Also, tweaked the shadows to make it feel more natural and added a drow shadow over the bg image.

### R1D5
I introduced a darkmode to the header and improved my linter configuration. The rest of the time i worked on my blog post entry about this mockup phase.
