The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 24, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
I worked among the icon system in my future blog app.
https://github.com/FrBosquet/franpress/commit/6bd931115b33408d42fbc0fc0a335ee4186886a1

### R1D2
I finalished my navigation header and started working on the option box for my posts.

### R1D3
I finished with the icon system and now all the icons works properly. I messed up a bit with the svg, so it deserves a future refactor. Pretty happy about it anyway.

### R1D4
Today i woke up earlier to complete my daily commitment. I added the copy of the page and the noisy bg, so the page is completed. Also, tweaked the shadows to make it feel more natural and added a drow shadow over the bg image.

### R1D5
I introduced a darkmode to the header and improved my linter configuration. The rest of the time i worked on my blog post entry about this mockup phase.

### R1D6
Today i begun to provide mock data to my components using recompose to build hocs.

### R1D7
I implemented a crappy JSON format to describe a post content and its formating, and a first parser. Much to work and extend here, but it does work as long as you dont nest strongs inside ems or any other combination.

### R1D8
I added three more content types to the body of my posts: Images, subtitles and list. I also worked on revamping my yesterday algorithm to go from text to nodes to be able to next strongs, ems and a tags, but sadly it didnt work. Ill try again tomorrow

### R1D9
Today i worked in the text parser implementing a test suite using jest

### R1D10
Second day using tdd to implement a text parsing algorithm. Very fun to do and a lot of progress, im near success for the custom text parsing.
https://github.com/FrBosquet/franpress/commit/83371801093b1776e8c19f69de6b3ccd49431899

### R1D11
I woke up early to work on my text parsing algorithm and finally ITS DONE. This has been tought, but using tdd and jest has made everything easier. Good lesson i got there. Now i will move forward and render some components using that output.
